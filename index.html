      <h3 id="caption1">Dear Sheryl,<br></h3>
      <p>Happy 22nd! Though I've known you for less than a year, I feel that we have forged strong ties with each other with the short time we spent together. It's unfortunate that we can't go to the US this year, if not for that, I would be celebrating your birthday with you this year.
       <br><br>You're the first person that I've ever met that's as adventureous as me, always looking for the next wild escape, even if it means risking your life, because, you live your everyday like it's your last. No regrets.
       <br><br>Sometimes I wish we met earlier, so I could have a travel buddy (finally) for my solo travels, but oh well, at least we still met!
       <br><br>I know we don't talk much nowadays, but let me tell you; I do enjoy your company even if we don't talk much, even on a long plane ride.
       <br><br>Before I end off this short letter, I want to thank you for being with me and putting up with me through my tough times, even though we literally just met.
       <br><br>I won't add on more, enjoy the rest of your special day!
       <br><br>I look forward to our next adventure, when COVID-19 leaves this earth.
      </p>
